# imvu-patcher
This is a patch to make the new IMVU Next Desktop app work on both windows and linux nativally

```
> go get -u github.com/Toyz/imvu-patcher
> imvu-patcher
```

All you have to do is run `imvu-patcher` every time you wish to run the Mac OS IMVU Next client on Windows or Linux

### Contributing
You can contribute to this project to help make it better such as optimizing the file patching and stuff for say linux

### TODO
- [ ] Package to allow installing
- [ ] Support chrome books (In theory this will already work on chrome but electron might not)
- [ ] Optimize patching for linux (Maybe use diffs instead)
